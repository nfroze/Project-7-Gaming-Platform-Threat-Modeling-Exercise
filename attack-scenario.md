# Potential Attack Scenario: How Winners Could Be Targeted

## Hypothetical Attack Demonstration

### Day 1: Intelligence Gathering
**Morning** - Attacker visits platform's winners page
- Identifies recent high-value winner username + profile photo
- Cross-references username in public breach databases
- Uses reverse image search on profile photo
- Builds target profile from available information
- Estimated time: 30-60 minutes

### Day 2: Initial Contact
**Morning** - Voicemail from spoofed number claiming to be "Platform Support"

**Afternoon** - Phishing email arrives:
```
From: security@platform-support.com ❌ 
(Real domain: support@platform.co.uk ✅)

Urgent: Suspicious account activity detected
Your recent winnings have been temporarily frozen.
Please call 0800-XXX-XXXX to verify your identity.
```

### Day 3: Social Engineering
**Morning** - Victim calls the fraudulent number
- Attacker references specific win amount and date
- Claims immediate action needed to "secure account"
- Requests login credentials "for verification"
- Asks for 2FA code "to implement new security"
- Account credentials compromised

**Result** - Attacker gains full account access

## Why This Attack Vector Works

- **Personalisation**: Attacker knows victim's username and recent win
- **Urgency**: Creates panic about losing winnings
- **Authority**: Spoofs legitimate company communications
- **Trust**: Elderly victims more likely to comply with "support"
