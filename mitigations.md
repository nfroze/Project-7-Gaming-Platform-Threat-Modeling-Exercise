# Mitigation Recommendations

## Phase 1: IMMEDIATE (No Cost)

**Privacy Quick Wins:**
1. Remove all profile photos from winners page
2. Replace real usernames with generic ones (Winner_12345, LuckyPlayer_678)
3. Add prominent security warning: "We will NEVER call asking for passwords"
4. Randomise display order (not chronological by win date)
5. Limit page to last 30 days of winners only
6. Add CAPTCHA to prevent automated scraping

*Rationale: Maintains "social proof" for marketing while eliminating targeting data*

## Phase 2: Short Term (Minimal Cost)

**Enhanced Authentication**
- Additional verification for high-value withdrawals
- Cooling-off period for payment method changes
- Alert on suspicious activity patterns

**Customer Education**
- Security awareness banner on login
- Post-win security guidance
- "Platform will never call asking for passwords" messaging

## Phase 3: Long Term (Strategic Investment)

**Comprehensive Privacy Programme**
- Opt-in only for all winner publicity
- Behavioural analytics for anomaly detection
- Regular security awareness campaigns
- Dedicated fraud prevention team training

## Expected Benefits

| Area | Current State | Improved State |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| Customer Privacy | Full exposure | User-controlled |
| Attack Surface | High | Significantly reduced |
| Regulatory Compliance | Potential issues | Best practice aligned |
| Brand Trust | At risk | Enhanced |

## Implementation Priority

**Critical Path:**
1. Remove/obscure identifying information (Day 1)
2. Add security warnings (Week 1)
3. Implement technical controls (Month 1)
4. Develop education programme (Ongoing)

## Industry Alignment

These recommendations align with:
- ICO privacy guidelines
- UKGC player protection requirements
- NCSC cyber security guidance
- Age UK fraud prevention recommendations

## Key Message

Every day that winner information remains fully public increases the window of opportunity for social engineering attacks. Implementing basic privacy controls demonstrates duty of care to vulnerable customers and aligns with industry best practices.
